# Weather App

This is an application written in Next.js to see what this React framework is all about. At the same time, I really liked it and found it more intuitive than pure React. When writing the next project, I wanted to see what styling in Tailwind is all about.
I chose the weather app because of its uncomplicated structure. And I didn't feel strong in transferring data between the client and the API. After writing this application, I wanted to practice contacting the API even more.


## Features

- You can enter the name of the city to display the weather for it. 
- You can try to detect your location to check the weather for your location.

## Tech Stack
